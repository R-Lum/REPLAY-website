We have finally launched the website for the [REPLAY project][replay]. We will use
it to report on the progress of the project, to inform about webinars and
other training opportunities, and to discuss some details concerning
the development of the [Luminescence](http://r-luminescence.org/) package.

At the moment the site is still sparse, but we'll populate it on a regular
basis. In the meantime, you can read our [About][about] page, which
describes the aims and goals of the REPLAY project.
