We have finally launched the website for the REPLAY project. We will use
it to report on the progress of the project, to inform about webinars and
other training opportunities, and to discuss some details concerning
the [Luminescence](http://r-luminescence.org/) package.

At the moment the site is still sparse, but we'll populate on a regular
basis. We have the [About](/about) page available to describe the aims
of the REPLAY project.
