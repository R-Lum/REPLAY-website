REPLAY is a DFG-funded programme ([No 528704761](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/528704761?language=en))
led by [Dr Sebastian Kreutzer](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/geomorph/kreutzer_en.html)
(PI at [Heidelberg University, DE](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en)) and
[Dr Thomas Kolb](https://www.uni-giessen.de/en/faculties/f07/departments/geography/sections/physical/staff/kolb-en)
(PI at [Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, DE](https://www.uni-giessen.de/en/)).

## REPLAY: REProducible Luminescence Data AnalYses

Reproducibility is a crucial element of science. In modern science, research
software is vital for the discovery process, and quality and accessibility
determine the reproducibility of results, such as in the field of
luminescence-based Geochronology.

Luminescence dating techniques are essential in Quaternary research,
constituting cornerstones in Earth and Archaeological Sciences and beyond.
Luminescence dating towards an age determination generates vast measurement
data and requires various analysis steps. However, a fragmented, partly
closed-source software landscape limits the transparency and reproducibility
of results, and measures of rigours and professional quality assurance are
seldom implemented.

REPLAY aims to build on the existing R-based software package
[Luminescence](https://r-luminescence.org/) to achieve the following
goals:

- foster a community-driven reproducible and open research software framework
in the bottom-up approach: the REPLAY system;

- implement the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
for research software;

- provide a community tailored, accessible and usable open-source software
suite enabling new analytical pathways promoting a re-evaluation and
reporting of existing data beyond the target community of geochronologists;

- facilitate interfaces from and to the REPLAY system to enable the
extraction of raw data and pattern recognition of big datasets using the
REPLAY system.

Finally, REPLAY aims to ensure long-term impacts in terms of visibility and
active community participation. They are combined with a professional
development workflow to secure long-term usability and sustained support of
the REPLAY system.

## About this Website

The REPLAY website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a
static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go, and the
[Mainroad](https://www.uni-giessen.de/en/) theme. Support for R code is
handled via the [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/) R package.
