			<p>Another 3 months exact from our <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/releases/tag/v1.1.1">previous release</a>, we are very proud to
announce the release of <strong>version 1.1.2</strong> of the <a href="https://r-lum.github.io/Luminescence/">Luminescence R package</a>.</p>
<p>This release comes with a many (mostly rare) crashes being fixed, a number of
cosmetic improvements to the plots, and a massive speed boost in the
<code>analyse_IRSAR.RF()</code> function. Behind the scenes, during these past months we
have introduced some improvements to our test infrastructure and continued our
process of deprecation of redundant functions. In total we addressed 109 issues
in 523 commits.</p>
<h3 id="regression-fixes">Regression fixes</h3>
<p>During this release cycle we became aware of a couple of small regression.</p>
<p>The first was provided by the newest member of the <a href="/REPLAY-website/team/">REPLAY team</a> Dirk
Mittelstraß, author of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OSLdecomposition/">OSLdecomposition package</a>. He found that
function <code>analyse_SAR.CWOSL()</code> could crash during the plotting phase with a
somewhat confusing <code>figure margins too large</code> error if the input was an object
with decomposed signal components generated from <code>OSLdecomposition</code>. Calling
the function a second time would then produce an error mentioning an <code>invalid graphics state</code>.</p>
<p>Crashes that occur while R is plotting are sometimes hard to debug, and even
more so if they happen only under specific conditions that depend on some
external state, such as the size of the plot device. Specifically, this error
didn&rsquo;t occur outside of RStudio or if the RStudio plot window was large enough,
but it could be triggered very consistently when working in RStudio on a laptop.</p>
<p>In cases when the cause of the error is completely mysterious, a good approach
towards finding a solution is to identify when the problem started. The best
tool for this job is <code>git bisect</code>: with this we can first mark as <code>bad</code> the
current development version and as <code>good</code> a working past version. From then on,
<code>git</code> can apply semi-automatically a bisection approach so that intermediate
versions can be tested until we find the one that introduced the bug. Once the
guilty commit was identified, finding the fix was easy. The complete details
are recorded in <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/1188">issue 1188</a>.</p>
<p>Another regression was introduced in v1.1.1 and affected <code>plot_RadialPlot()</code>:
<a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/1106">the <code>stats</code> argument was no longer functional</a>, and therefore it was
not possible to mark the maximum, minimum and median points in the plot. That
went unnoticed because we didn&rsquo;t have a graphical snapshot that used that
argument. The fix included amending one of the snapshots to specify <code>stats</code> so
that future regressions of this type will not occur.</p>
<p>A final regression affected <code>plot_DoseResponseCurve()</code> (and consequently also
<code>analyse_SAR.CWOSL()</code> and <code>analyse_pIRIRSequence()</code>), and had to do once again
with a <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/1072">mismatch between symbols and labels in the legend</a>. We had
already had a fix for a similar issue in the previous release, but at that time
we didn&rsquo;t notice that <code>mode = &quot;extrapolation&quot;</code> had not been taken care of.
We have carefully reviewed all cases, and hopefully this problem has now been
fixed for real.</p>
<h3 id="graphical-improvements">Graphical improvements</h3>
<p>A large number of small improvements to plots have occurred, so below we
present only a selection of the most interesting ones.</p>
<p>Function <code>analyse_baSAR()</code> <a href="i1058">overplotted the dose response curves</a> when
fewer than 1,000 iterations for the Markov chain Monte Carlo were used. The
function had an hardcoded value of 1,000 curves to draw, meant to provide a
way of thinning the results if a much larger number of MCMC iterations were
used. However, due to R&rsquo;s vector recycling rules, for runs that had fewer than
1,000 iterations this caused the same curves to be plotted multiple times over
each other, thus appearing much darker than expected. Besides, this also caused
a slowdown, as curve drawing is not vectorized. In the example below, we can
compare the previous plot (left, 58s to produce) and the current one (right, 26s).
<img src="issue_1058.png#center" alt="analyse_baSAR plot" title="Comparison of the previous (left) and current (right) plots"></p>
<p>We introduced a number of improvements in the plots generated by <code>analyse_pIRIRSequence()</code>.
In particular we tried to <a href="i1219">make better use of the plot area</a> so that not
too much blank space is left. The rejection criteria subplot on the bottom right
has also seen <a href="i1208">improvements in the layout of labels and legend</a> so that
they should no longer intersect with the boxes.
<img src="issue_1208_1219.png#center" alt="analyse_pIRIRSequence plot" title="Comparison of the previous (left) and current (right) plots">
Note that these plots still look a bit crammed only because that&rsquo;s the
resolution available when generating the graphical snapshots. With the default
plot sizes in R, they will generally look better.</p>
<p>Also the rejection criteria plot of <code>analyse_SAR.CWOSL()</code> has seen some slight
modifications. The feedback we have received so far has been slightly negative,
so we&rsquo;ll try to further improve this plot in the future. In the meantime, the
little touches we have applied should already <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/1223">improve clarity and presentation</a>:
<img src="issue_1223.png#center" alt="Rejection criteria plot" title="Comparison of the previous (left) and current (right) plots">
As can be seen above, we do not shorten the criteria labels unless strictly
necessary, so their names are more legible. Moreover, we now use a <code>&lt;=</code> or <code>&gt;=</code>
sign (rather than the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> used previously) so that it&rsquo;s more obvious which
side of the threshold is the desired one.</p>
<p>For <code>plot_RadialPlot()</code> we <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/1194">fixed some weird artifacts</a> that could
appear if two inputs had wildly different distributions:
<img src="issue_1194.png" alt="plot_RadialPlot" title="Comparison of the previous (left) and current (right) plots"></p>
<p>This is something that it&rsquo;s not very likely to appear under normal conditions,
but it can be triggered quite easily when playing with the function&rsquo;s setting
with <a href="https://tzerk.github.io/RLumShiny/">RLumShiny</a>, and there it was quite jarring to see those
artifacts.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h2>
<p>Already for <a href="v100">version 1.0</a> of <code>Luminescence</code> we had boosted the performance
of <code>analyse_IRSAR.RF()</code>. In this release cycle we identified two further
optimizations in our C++ implementation (see <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/1210">issue 1210</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/1230">issue 1230</a> for a discussion of the implementation details). Across
several test cases, these changes yielded at least a 45% speed-up, as can
be seen in the table below (times are in seconds).</p>
<table>

          <th>version</th>

          <td style="text-align: right">40.1</td>
      </tr>

<p>It turns out that these changes also reduced our code size, which is very
welcome for a package of the size of <code>Luminescence</code> given CRAN&rsquo;s strict limits.
The table below reports the object file sizes in bytes for the C++ engine of
<code>analyse_IRSAR.RF()</code> and of for the entire dynamic library of the package:</p>

<h3 id="test-parallelization">Test parallelization</h3>
<p>Our testsuite contains now 3,316 tests (we had 3,253 in 1.1.1), with the
largest increase being in the number of graphical snapshots (from 90 to 154)
and numerical snapshots (from 180 to 225).</p>
<p>Our set of testcases has always taken a few minutes to run, which can feel
like ages when developing. However, with the number of tests always growing,
we felt it was time to implement <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/991">parallelism in our test suite</a>. On
paper this sounded straightforward, as the <code>testthat</code> package only requires
to add the following line to the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file to operate in parallel:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Config<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>testthat<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>parallel<span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">TRUE</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In reality, this exposed a number of cases in which subtle (and unexpected)
dependencies between tests existed. These were mainly due to the way R handles
the graphical device.</p>
<p>Effectively, each time some graphical parameters are set before a plot is drawn,
these persist also after the plot is completed. This is intentional in base R
so that it&rsquo;s possible to add plot elements (such as additional lines or text)
after the main plot is drawn. However, this design means that the settings for
a plot can affect subsequent plots if they are not properly reset.</p>
<p>Already in the past we had
discovered and fixed a few of these, but the number of other cases that this
parallelisation effort uncovered was really quite astonishing. It took us 3
attempts and various fixes throughout the codebase before the simple change
above could be left in permanently, as each time new failures were discovered
by the continous integration servers.</p>
<p>The way out was to use a little-known utility present in the <code>testthat</code> package,
the so called <a href="stins">state inspector</a>. This allows to record and compare the
value of a set of variables of interest before and after each test file is run.
If these are not identical, it means that the running of a function has altered
the global state, and thus it can potentially affect subsequent functions. In
our case, we were eventually able to define the set of graphical parameters of
interest (ignoring those that get changed automatically upon the modification
of other parameters) with this function:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using this function also revealed a <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/2237">small bug in <code>testthat</code></a>, which
led to the introduction of the <code>tolerance</code> parameter used above.</p>
<p>All this effort has been largely rewarded, as now tests run locally in about
1 minute when using 8 cores (instead of 5.5 minutes of a single-core run),
because while a slow test is occupying one of the cores, the rest of the
tests can progress on other cores. This speed up is also visible on the
continuous integration infrastructure where, although only 2 cores can be used,
test times (including building the package and its dependencies and coverage
analysis) have gone from about 17m to about 11m.</p>
<h3 id="function-removals-and-deprecations">Function removals and deprecations</h3>
<p>One of the ambitious goals of the REPLAY project is to ensure that the package
will stay alive for the next 10 years. To achieve this we need to ensure that
we do not carry around functionality that is no longer of use or that has been
reimplemented in a better fashion.</p>
<p>As part of this, we constantly deprecate functions so to give time to users to
prepare for upcoming removals. When a function is deprecated, it will raise a
warning when it&rsquo;s used, so the people using it will notice. Also this time we
have marked a few functions as deprecated; they will be removed in the next
release.</p>
<p>Functions <code>is.RLum()</code>, <code>is.RLum.Data()</code>, <code>is.RLum.Data.Curve()</code>,
<code>is.RLum.Data.Spectrum()</code>, <code>is.RLum.Data.Image()</code>, <code>is.RLum.Analysis()</code> and
<code>is.RLum.Results()</code> were meant to provide a straigthforward way to test the
class of objects created by <code>Luminescence</code>. In reality, they were almost never
used internally because they incur a (small) cost due to the S3 method dispatch
in R. We also believe that outside of the package they do not have much of an
audience (beside perhaps other package authors). Given that a fast and
reliable way of testing whether an object is of a given type only requires
using the <code>inherits()</code> function, as in <code>inherits(object, &quot;RLum.Data.Curve&quot;)</code>,
there is effectively no loss of functionality with their planned removal.</p>
<p>Functions <code>github_commits()</code>, <code>github_branches()</code> and <code>github_issues()</code> have
been deprecated because they are out of scope for the <code>Luminescence</code> package.
They were written when the functionality of <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> was
somewhat weaker, but now they are no longer worth keeping and maintaining.</p>
<p>Functions <code>CW2pHMi()</code>, <code>CW2pLM()</code>, <code>CW2pLMi()</code> and <code>CW2pPMi()</code> (deprecated
since 1.0.0) have been removed, but their functionality remains in the
corresponding <code>convert_CW2pHMi()</code>, <code>convert_CW2pLM()</code>, <code>convert_CW2pLMi()</code> and
<code>convert_CW2pPMi()</code> functions.</p>
<h3 id="upcoming-work">Upcoming work</h3>
<p>We foresee for the next release to have a few new functions added to the
package, as well as even more cosmetic and stability improvements.
If you are affected by bugs or even just small annoyances with the package,
the best course of action is to <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues">report an issue</a> (preferably with steps
to reproduce). And if you&rsquo;d like to contribute new functionalities or provide
a bug fix directly, check out our <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">guidelines for contributors</a>.</p>
