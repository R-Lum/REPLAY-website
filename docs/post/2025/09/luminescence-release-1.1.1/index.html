			<p>Exactly 3 months from our <a href="/REPLAY-website/post/2025/06/luminescence-release-1.1.0/">previous release</a>, we are excited to
announce the release of <strong>version 1.1.1</strong> of the <a href="https://r-lum.github.io/Luminescence/">Luminescence R package</a>.</p>
<p>We were initially wondering whether this should be a minor or a major release,
as we put a lot of effort in to make the package more solid and refined; we
decided to call it a minor release just because there are not many new
features in this version. However, there are some important regression fixes,
many graphical improvements and also some performance speed-ups. In total we
addressed 69 issues in 371 commits.</p>
<h3 id="one-new-function-and-some-removals">One new function and some removals</h3>
<p>Only one new small function was added in this release, <code>correct_PMTLinearity()</code>,
which can be used to correct the linearity of photomultiplier tube (PMT) counts
to avoid saturation effects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we removed a few functions that we already set as defunct
or deprecated in previous releases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Analyse_SAR.OSLdata()</code> was an earlier version of what was then reimplemented
in a more complete way in <code>analyse_SAR.CWOSL()</code></li>
<li><code>calc_Kars2008()</code> had been since several versions just a shim to
<code>calc_Huntley2006()</code></li>
<li><code>PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()</code> was renamed to <code>convert_PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()</code></li>
<li><code>Second2Gray()</code> was renamed to <code>convert_Second2Gray()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we removed <code>get_Risoe.BINfileData()</code> directly because the only
thing it did was to report that it could not do anything. This was a leftover
from ancient designs that never materialised, so we did not go through the
usual process of deprecating a function before its removal.</p>
<p>More removals of deprecated functions will occur in the next release, so if
you already see some deprecation warnings, you&rsquo;d better sorting them out in
advance.</p>
<h3 id="regression-fixes">Regression fixes</h3>
<p>A regression that affected <code>plot_DoseResponseCurve()</code> (and consequently also
<code>analyse_SAR.CWOSL()</code> and <code>analyse_pIRIRSequence()</code>) caused a mismatch between
the legend symbols and the plotted regeneration/dose points.</p>
<p>This can be seen from these plots, where on the left is the one produced by
version 1.1.0 and on the right is the fixed version produced by version 1.1.1:
<img src="DoseResponseCurve.png" alt="DRC plots" title="Comparison of the mismatched points (left) and fixed (right)"></p>
<p>The difference is at first subtle, but it&rsquo;s clear that the previous version
assigned the plotted the points using the wrong symbols, thus making the plot
very confusing and not really usable.</p>
<p>Also <code>plot_DRCSummary()</code> saw its functionality restored, after a regression
prevented the dose-response curve from being plotted, resulting in a mostly
empty plot.</p>
<p>We also discovered a regression in <code>calc_Huntley2006()</code>: after the work we
put during the <a href="/REPLAY-website/post/2025/02/the-road-to-luminescence-1.0/">1.0.0 release</a> to speed up the function, an unintentional
change snuck it that made it slow again. This had originally passed under our
radar, and we realised only by chance when collecting some numbers on the
performance improvements we could measure in the package. Well, it turns out
that for <code>calc_Huntley2006()</code> we couldn&rsquo;t see any.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/867">some investigation</a>, it turned out that the <code>n.MC</code>
argument meant to control the number of Monte Carlo iterations in the function
was also being passed to <code>fit_DoseResponseCurve()</code>. This effectively doubled
the amount of work done for no perceptible gain. This was not the expected
behaviour, and explained the poor performance. After the fix, we saw a 2x
speedup for our default value of 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations.</p>
<h2 id="correctness-and-functionality-improvements">Correctness and functionality improvements</h2>
<p>A question that has come up a few times in the context of the
<code>fit_DoseResponseCurve()</code> is what should be done when the fit produces
a negative De value in the default &ldquo;interpolation&rdquo; mode.
The answer to that is that such value is meaningless and
should not be reported. Most of the times, such values are generated if the
dataset is somewhat misspecified or presents other peculiarities.</p>
<p>However, looking into this made us realise that our handling of negative values
was imprecise. In particular, the computation of the De.MC, De.Error and
HPDI (Highest Density Intervals) as implemented in  <code>fit_DoseResponseCurve()</code>
was not entirely correct, and produced some confusing results in those cases.</p>
<p>We believe to have solved the issue, and in doing so, we also made the output
clearer by reordering some columns and clarifying those that are reported only
for internal use.</p>
<p>Also <code>calc_Statistics()</code> has seen a small correctness improvement: what was
previously reported as the weighted median was actually a simple (unweighted)
median. We have now revamped the internal helper function to compute the
weighted median so that it could be used also inside <code>calc_Statistics()</code>, and
now the function reports the expected value.</p>
<p>In <code>smooth_RLum()</code>we have added support for the Poisson smoother of Carter
et al. (2018). This smoother is helpful to ensure that the dark-background
counts signals measured by a photomultiplier tube follow a Poisson statistic:
values that are statistically unlikely to be coming from a Poisson distribution
(according to a user-controlled threshold) can be smoothed out using the
average over four neighbours.</p>
<p><code>get_RLum()</code> is a function that is used quite often inside the package to
handle and transform the classes of objects generated by <code>Luminescence</code> (such
as <code>RLum.Analysis</code>, <code>RLum.Data.Curve</code>, and so on). An <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/875">internal optimization</a>
increased the speed of the function, but this is noticeable only when handling
a sufficiently large number of objects. For example, when merging a list of
79 <code>RLum.Analysis</code> objects, each containing 118 curves, we saw the time spent
by <code>merge_RLum()</code> go from 3.5s to 1.5s.</p>
<h3 id="code-size-reduction">Code size reduction</h3>
<p>One small internal change has brought a surprising reduction in number of
lines in the package.</p>
<p>Since R version 4.4.0 (released in April 2024), the new <code>%||%</code> operator has
been added to the language. The way it works is rather simple: an expression
like <code>L %||% R</code> returns <code>L</code> if <code>L</code> is not <code>NULL</code>, otherwise it returns <code>R</code>.
In other words, it checks if the first argument is <code>NULL</code> before using it; if
it turns out to be <code>NULL</code>, then it reverts to the second argument, which can
be thought of as a default value.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that the implementation of this operator is really
straightforward, as it&rsquo;s literally just:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">is.null</span>(L)) R <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> L
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This means that we could start using it even though at the moment <code>Luminescence</code>
still supports R 4.3, by providing our own implementation.</p>
<p>In practice, this new operator lets us transform this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span style="display:flex;"><span>main <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">is.null</span>(plot.settings<span style="color:#f92672">$</span>main[[i]])) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  temp[[i]]<span style="color:#f92672">@</span>recordType
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>} <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  plot.settings<span style="color:#f92672">$</span>main[[i]]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>into this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-R" data-lang="R"><span style="display:flex;"><span>main <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span> plot.settings<span style="color:#f92672">$</span>main[[i]] <span style="color:#f92672">%||%</span> temp[[i]]<span style="color:#f92672">@</span>recordType
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we introduced
it in <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues/955">issue 955</a>, it was clear that it could make some of the code
less verbose and more readable, but it was a pleasant surprise to see that
overall this let us remove over 250 lines of code (that&rsquo;s almost 1% of the
total R code in the package).</p>
<p>Talking about package size, this release contains 26,580 lines of code, a
sizable decrease from the 27,604 of just three months ago. This
is the result of the function removals mentioned above, but also of a massive
consolidation of duplicated code in <code>plot_AbanicoPlot()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="stability-improvements">Stability improvements</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recently discussed of <a href="/REPLAY-website/post/2025/08/breaking-luminescence-to-improve-it/">fuzz testing</a>, and in this release we
spent some time trying to figure out new ways of making <code>Luminescence</code> crash,
so that we could get some insight into it and make it more robust.</p>
<p>In this release we filed and fixed <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/issues?q=state%3Aclosed%20label%3Afuzzing%20milestone%3Av1.1.1">19 issues discovered by fuzzing</a>,
which is the most we&rsquo;ve ever found, accounting for more than half of the total.
This was due to the time spent refining the <a href="https://mcol.github.io/caught-by-the-fuzz/">CBTF package</a> so that it
could be released on CRAN.</p>
<p>In terms of testing, our testsuite contains now 3,253 tests, which is a 5%
increase from our previous release (we had 3,088 in 1.1.0). Many are snapshot
and graphical snapshot tests, which are the type of test that can give us the
best protection against unintentional changes.</p>
<h3 id="upcoming-work">Upcoming work</h3>
<p>In the short term we&rsquo;ll resume working on <code>RLumShiny</code>, to further expand the
set of applications it provides and perhaps improve its performance.</p>
<p>As always, bug reports are very welcome, in particular if you spot regression
or performance problems. And if you&rsquo;d like to contribute new functionalities
or bug fixes, check out our <a href="https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">guidelines for contributors</a>.</p>
